# Tap_Controller
Control Application for LED Tap Shoes wireless system

This application connects to an custom-made transmitter (based on Adafruit Feather M0) over USB. It allows direct control of the transmitter to control LED Tap Shoes. The application is also capable of creating a cue list and exporting cuelists to .xml. The application can also configure the DMX address of the transmitters for when they are being used in a perfomance.

I included the Inno Scripts as a reference for building .exe executables for windows.

The application is built in python using wxWidgets and targets Windows 10 for deployment.
